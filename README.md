# Grain Growth 
Key Features:

    Cellular Automata Rules:
    The program implements a set of rules based on cellular automata principles to model the behavior of individual grains. Each cell represents a discrete space where grains can grow, and their evolution is governed by predefined rules.

    Seed Generation:
    Users can initialize the simulation by seeding the grid with an initial configuration of grains. This step sets the starting conditions for the grain growth simulation.

    Grain Growth Dynamics:
    The cellular automata evolve over multiple iterations, mimicking the growth and interaction of grains in a material. The dynamics consider factors such as energy minimization and neighborhood effects, influencing the evolution of each cell.

    Visualization:
    The program provides visualization tools to observe the evolving grain structure. Users can track changes over time, aiding in the analysis of grain growth patterns and the emergence of microstructures.

Compatibility:
The program is developed in Java Swing, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.
