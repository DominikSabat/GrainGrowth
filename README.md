# Grain Growth 
Key Features:

    Cellular Automata Rules:
    The program implements a set of rules based on cellular automata principles to model the behavior of individual grains. Each cell represents a discrete space where grains can grow, and their evolution is governed by predefined rules.

    Seed Generation:
    Users can initialize the simulation by seeding the grid with an initial configuration of grains. This step sets the starting conditions for the grain growth simulation.

    Grain Growth Dynamics:
    The cellular automata evolve over multiple iterations, mimicking the growth and interaction of grains in a material. The dynamics consider factors such as neighborhood effects, influencing the evolution of each cell.

    Visualization:
    The program provides visualization tools to observe the evolving grain structure. Users can track changes over time, aiding in the analysis of grain growth patterns and the emergence of microstructures.
